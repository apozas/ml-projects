# Energy-based models in Pytorch

Author: Alejandro Pozas Kerstjens

Implementation of different generative models based on energy-based learning. Examples are provided
with the MNIST dataset.

Libraries required:
- [pytorch](http://www.pytorch.org) as ML framework
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for math operations
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for image visualization
- [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) for custom progress bar
- [imageio](http://imageio.github.io/) for exporting outputs to ``.gif`` format

## 1. RBM
[Restricted Boltzmann Machine](http://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Volume%201/Chap6_PDP86.pdf)
with binary visible and hidden units. Although in this example it is used as a generative model,
RBMs can also perform supervised tasks.
#### Example

## 2. Continuous RBM
Restricted Boltzmann Machine with binary hidden but continuous visible units.
#### Example

## 3. Deep Belief Network
Deep belief network with greedy pre-training plus global finetuning.
#### Example

## 4. To-Do list
- [ ] Implement [Persistent Contrastive Divergence](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/pcd/pcd.pdf) for training
- [x] [Deep Belief Network](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks) with binary
visible units
- [x] Deep Belief Network with continuous visible units
- [ ] Remove the distinction between `Variable` and `Parameter` by just using
`torch.Tensor`s
